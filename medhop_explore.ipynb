We herein report cytotoxicity of advanced glycation end-products ( AGEs ) on pancreatic beta cells . AGEs stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation but did not arrest proliferation of the P01308 -1 cell line . Pancreatic beta cell lines or primary cultured islets possess a receptor for P51606 ( RAGE ) , and its expression increased after P51606 treatment . TUNEL staining and FACS analysis using annexin V/PI antibodies showed that apoptosis increased in P01308 -1 cells or primary cultured islets when incubated with BSA conjugated with glyceraldehyde ( AGE2 ) or glucoaldehyde ( AGE3 ) , compared with those conjugated with glucose ( AGE1 ) . Reaction of P01308 -1 cells to Ki67 , which is a cellular marker for proliferation , was also increased after P51606 treatment . The ability of primary cultured islets to secrete insulin was retained even after P51606 treatment under either low or high glucose conditions . The antiserum against RAGE partially prevented P51606 -induced cellular events . Treatment of beta cells with the antioxidant metallothionein results in a significant reduction in pathologic changes . AGEs might be able to induce apoptosis as well as proliferation of pancreatic beta cell lines or primary cultured islets . Moreover , antibody array showed that Q06609 and P43351 were significantly decreased in AGE2-treated P01308 -1 cells . AGEs might inhibit homologous DNA recombination for repairing DNA of P01308 -1 cells damaged by ROS generation . It might be suggested that treatment of AGEs resulted in ROS production and apoptosis through their receptor on pancreatic beta cells . AGEs might deteriorate function of pancreatic beta cells in patients with long-term hyperglycemia .'"
